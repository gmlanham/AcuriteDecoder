# AcuriteDecoder
The purpose of this library is to receive Acurite 433MHz, radio signals, and decode it to digital weather data. The weather data is assigned to string variables, that are contained in a data structure, weatherStruct, so that 3 variables (wind, temperature and humidity) are returned from one function, getWeather(int dataInputPin).  The 433MHz radio receiver pin is connected to data input pin. Which pin depends on your hardware. I use pin 10 on the Arudino Uno. 

Each Accurite Weather unit has a channel code, identifier. My unit has a 3-in-1 sensor with channel code of 3619; your's will be different. Note: the radio pulse sequence varies according the type of sensor. The decoding in this library is for the Acurite 3-in-1 sensor. The radio signal was decoded using Audacity 2.1.0, opensource software. The data is sent in short packets at ~18 second intervals.
